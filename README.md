# Octarine Security Demo

This repository is to help demonstrate how to hack into k8s cluster using privilege escalation. 
It's based on [bgeesaman](https://github.com/bgeesaman/k8s-security-demos/blob/master/README.md) demo.

Here you will find two scenarios you can use to try hacking your k8s environment 
1. [compromised-container](./compromised-container/README.md)
2. [privilege-escalation](./privilege-escalation/README.md)
